# Simon-Game
A simple memory game created using HTML, CSS and JQuery . Worked on this game during my udemy webdevelopment course. 

# Game Rules 
- Start the game by pressing a button. Each time you get the sequence right the game will increase your level. 


1. Watch the Sequence: Simon will light up one of its four colored buttons (red, blue, green, yellow) and play a corresponding tone. Watch and listen carefully.

2. Repeat the Sequence: Press the button that matches the color and sound in the sequence.

3. Increase Sequence: After each successful repetition, Simon will add one more color and sound to the sequence. Watch the new, longer sequence carefully.
Continue Playing: Repeat the entire sequence, including the new addition. Each time you get it right, Simon adds another step to the sequence.

4. Make a Mistake: If you press the wrong button, Simon will emit a buzzer sound, indicating an error. Depending on the game mode, this might end the game, or you might get a chance to try the sequence again.
